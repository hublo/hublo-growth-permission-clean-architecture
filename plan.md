## Introduction (1 min)

- Briefly introduce the team and the topic.
- Outline the objectives of the presentation.

## Context (2 min)

- Describe the need for a new system to manage user permissions.
  - historic, legacy (sails, etc)
- Explain the choice of a clean design approach.
- Highlight the discussion process that led to the selection of clean architecture.

## Why clean architecture? (3 min) "TOOM"
 
- Define clean architecture and its relevance to the project (SOLID, etc.)

- Explain the alignment of clean architecture principles with the project's goals.

## Architecture Overview (5 min)

- Present the architecture of the system. 
  - Schemas
- Illustrate how clean architecture influences the architectural decisions.


## Components and Implementation (5 min)

- Detail the key components of the system (e.g., entities, use-cases, ports, builders, repositories).
- Showcase code snippets/examples in TypeScript.
- Explain how TypeScript enhances clean architecture implementation (type safety, interfaces, etc.).

## Benefits of the Chosen Approach (5 min) "TOOM/VALE"

- Clean Code and Maintainability: 
  - readability, clear function name
  - Discuss how clean architecture and TypeScript contribute to cleaner
  - more maintainable code.
  - etc.
- Some DDD principles : 
  - Entity encapsulate business logic
- Enhanced Testing: Explain how the approach leads to more realistic and manageable unit tests (stubs, etc.)
- Developer Experience: Share insights on how this approach makes coding more enjoyable and efficient.

## Challenges and Downsides (5 min)

- Code Volume: Address the concern of increased code lines due to clean architecture and TypeScript.
- Compatibility Issues: Discuss compatibility challenges (Prisma, mixins, etc.).
- Learning Curve: Acknowledge the learning curve associated with clean architecture and TypeScript for new team members.
- Discuss the role of TypeScript and NestJS in this architecture (Mixin, etc.)

## Conclusion (2 min)

- Summarize the key points.
- Highlight the outcomes and lessons learned.
- Reiterate the value of using TypeScript, NestJS and clean architecture in your specific context.

## Q&A Session (5 min)

- Open the floor for questions.
- Prepare to address anticipated questions based on the presentation content.
