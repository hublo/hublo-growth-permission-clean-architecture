# Benefits of Clean Architecture

---

## **Flexibility**
Easily adapt to new requirements without significant rework.

> "Embracing Clean Architecture and its no coupling philosophy means we can easily add or change any business rule"

---

## **Testability**
Independent layers allow for testing of business logic without UI, database, or external dependencies.

> "Clean Architecture allow us to use real implementations suitable for our tests that preserve all business rules instead of meaningless mocks"

---

## **Maintainability**
Easily adapt to changes in the ecosystem.

> "Embracing Clean Architecture means we can easily update or change any third-party dependency"

Note: Only god can judge me.
---

## **Team Alignment**
Code is the best documentation.

> "The use of prosaic code and ubiquitous language within the business rules allow more clinical and standard specifications of the features before development and improve understanding for non-initiated people, techy or not techy."

Note: Clean Architecture's structured layers significantly improve the readability and navigability of our codebase. This clarity is especially beneficial for onboarding new team members and facilitating cross-team collaboration. When everyone can easily understand how the permissions framework fits within the larger system, it accelerates development and enhances the quality of our software. It's about making our codebase more accessible and manageable for everyone involved.
