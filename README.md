## reveal-md

We use reveal in order to create presentations from Markdown files.

## Installation

```console
npm install -g reveal-md
```

## Usage

```console
reveal-md slides.md
```

This starts a local server and opens any Markdown file as a reveal.js presentation in the default browser.



## Context

We wanted to do something that would set some bases of our next developments
So that the team, we would be all aligned on same bases, not for this one but next developments

We departed from personal experience and good practices knowledge of the team
We decided then to do something that 
- would perdure
- would be adaptable
- could be standarised

Our choices where 
- use clean architecture mainly
- take the more decisions that would lead us to decoupled code
- unit tests
